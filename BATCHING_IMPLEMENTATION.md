# ETL Batching Implementation

This document outlines the batching implementation across all ETL jobs in the FinTrack project.

## Overview

All ETL jobs now implement batching logic to improve performance, scalability, and error handling when processing large datasets. Each job processes data in configurable batch sizes and sends completion messages with batch metadata.

## Jobs with Batching Implementation

### 1. fetch_market_data.py
- **Batch Size**: 100 assets per batch
- **Purpose**: Fetch real-time market data for assets
- **Batch Metadata**: 
  - `totalBatches`: Total number of batches processed
  - `totalAssets`: Total number of assets processed
  - `processingTimeMs`: Total processing time in milliseconds
  - `status`: "complete"

### 2. fetch_market_index_data.py
- **Batch Size**: 100 symbols per batch
- **Purpose**: Fetch market index data for symbols
- **Batch Metadata**:
  - `totalBatches`: Total number of batches processed
  - `totalSymbols`: Total number of symbols processed
  - `processingTimeMs`: Total processing time in milliseconds
  - `status`: "complete"

### 3. fetch_historical_market_data.py
- **Batch Size**: 50 symbols per batch (smaller due to API rate limits)
- **Purpose**: Fetch historical market data for assets
- **Batch Metadata**:
  - `totalBatches`: Total number of batches processed
  - `totalAssets`: Total number of assets processed
  - `processingTimeMs`: Total processing time in milliseconds
  - `status`: "complete"

## Benefits of Batching

### 1. **Scalability**
- Prevents memory overflow when processing large datasets
- Allows processing of thousands of records efficiently
- Reduces database connection pressure

### 2. **Error Handling**
- If one batch fails, other batches can still complete
- Better error isolation and recovery
- Progress tracking for partial completions

### 3. **Performance**
- Better resource utilization
- Reduced API rate limiting issues
- Improved database performance with smaller transaction sizes

### 4. **User Experience**
- Immediate response with progress tracking
- Cache-first strategies for better perceived performance
- Batch completion notifications

## Batch Size Considerations

### Market Data Jobs (100 per batch)
- Higher batch sizes due to simpler API calls
- Faster processing with minimal complexity
- Lower risk of timeouts

### Historical Data Jobs (50 per batch)
- Smaller batches due to API rate limits
- More complex data processing
- Higher risk of timeouts

## Kafka Message Structure

All completion messages now include batch metadata:

```json
{
  "status": "complete",
  "totalBatches": 30,
  "totalAssets": 3000,
  "processingTimeMs": 45000,
  "assets": [...],
  "account_id": "user123"
}
```

## Monitoring and Metrics

### Log Messages
- Batch start and completion messages
- Processing time per batch
- Total processing statistics

### Performance Metrics
- Processing time per batch
- Total processing time
- Records processed per second
- Error rates per batch
