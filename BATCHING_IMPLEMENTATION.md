# ETL Batching Implementation

This document outlines the batching implementation across all ETL jobs in the FinTrack project.

## Overview

All ETL jobs now implement batching logic to improve performance, scalability, and error handling when processing large datasets. Each job processes data in configurable batch sizes and sends completion messages with batch metadata.

## Jobs with Batching Implementation

### 1. fetch_market_data.py
- **Batch Size**: 100 assets per batch
- **Purpose**: Fetch real-time market data for assets
- **Batch Metadata**: 
  - `totalBatches`: Total number of batches processed
  - `totalTransactions`: Total number of assets processed
  - `processingTimeMs`: Total processing time in milliseconds
  - `status`: "complete"

### 2. fetch_market_index_data.py
- **Batch Size**: 100 symbols per batch
- **Purpose**: Fetch market index data for symbols
- **Batch Metadata**:
  - `totalBatches`: Total number of batches processed
  - `totalSymbols`: Total number of symbols processed
  - `processingTimeMs`: Total processing time in milliseconds
  - `status`: "complete"

### 3. fetch_historical_market_data.py
- **Batch Size**: 50 symbols per batch (smaller due to API rate limits)
- **Purpose**: Fetch historical market data for assets
- **Batch Metadata**:
  - `totalBatches`: Total number of batches processed
  - `totalAssets`: Total number of assets processed
  - `processingTimeMs`: Total processing time in milliseconds
  - `status`: "complete"

### 4. process_transactions_to_holdings.py
- **Batch Size**: 100 assets per batch
- **Purpose**: Process transactions and update holdings
- **Batch Metadata**:
  - `totalBatches`: Total number of batches processed
  - `totalTransactions`: Total number of transactions processed
  - `processingTimeMs`: Total processing time in milliseconds
  - `status`: "complete"

### 5. process_transactions_to_holdings_monthly.py
- **Batch Size**: 50 assets per batch (smaller due to complex calculations)
- **Purpose**: Process transactions and update monthly holdings
- **Batch Metadata**:
  - `totalBatches`: Total number of batches processed
  - `totalAssets`: Total number of assets processed
  - `processingTimeMs`: Total processing time in milliseconds
  - `status`: "transactions_processed"

## Benefits of Batching

### 1. **Scalability**
- Prevents memory overflow when processing large datasets
- Allows processing of thousands of records efficiently
- Reduces database connection pressure

### 2. **Error Handling**
- If one batch fails, other batches can still complete
- Better error isolation and recovery
- Progress tracking for partial completions

### 3. **Performance**
- Better resource utilization
- Reduced API rate limiting issues
- Improved database performance with smaller transaction sizes

### 4. **User Experience**
- Immediate response with progress tracking
- Cache-first strategies for better perceived performance
- Batch completion notifications

## Batch Size Considerations

### Market Data Jobs (100 per batch)
- Higher batch sizes due to simpler API calls
- Faster processing with minimal complexity
- Lower risk of timeouts

### Historical Data Jobs (50 per batch)
- Smaller batches due to API rate limits
- More complex data processing
- Higher risk of timeouts

### Holdings Processing Jobs (50-100 per batch)
- Variable batch sizes based on complexity
- Database-intensive operations
- Balance between performance and resource usage

## Kafka Message Structure

All completion messages now include batch metadata:

```json
{
  "status": "complete",
  "totalBatches": 30,
  "totalAssets": 3000,
  "processingTimeMs": 45000,
  "assets": [...],
  "account_id": "user123"
}
```

## Monitoring and Metrics

### Log Messages
- Batch start and completion messages
- Processing time per batch
- Total processing statistics

### Performance Metrics
- Processing time per batch
- Total processing time
- Records processed per second
- Error rates per batch

## Future Enhancements

### 1. **Dynamic Batch Sizing**
- Adjust batch sizes based on system load
- Adaptive batching based on API response times
- Performance-based optimization

### 2. **Parallel Processing**
- Process multiple batches concurrently
- Worker pool implementation
- Load balancing across workers

### 3. **Advanced Error Handling**
- Retry mechanisms for failed batches
- Circuit breaker patterns
- Dead letter queues for failed records

### 4. **Real-time Monitoring**
- Live progress tracking
- Performance dashboards
- Alert systems for batch failures

## Configuration

Batch sizes can be configured by modifying the `batch_size` variable in each job:

```python
# Example configuration
batch_size = 100  # Adjust based on job requirements
```

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- Test batch processing logic
- Verify batch metadata generation
- Test error handling scenarios

### Integration Tests
- Test end-to-end batch processing
- Verify Kafka message structure
- Test performance with large datasets

### Load Tests
- Test with maximum batch sizes
- Verify system stability under load
- Test concurrent job execution
